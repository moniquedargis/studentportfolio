In this folder, you'll find the components of my final project for SEIS 610 - Software Engineering, taken in Fall 2017 as part of the MS in Data Science curriculum at the University of St. Thomas.

This was a solo project in which students were asked to create a plan for software they'd like to develop. The goal of this proejct was not to actually develop the software described - rather, to lay out a plan and practice many of the steps involved in the software engineering process.

I chose to work through the stages of software development for a standardized test preparation data storage system because, before I began my Data Science career, I worked for many years as a standardized test prep instructor and tutor. I was always frustrated that none of the test prep data storage solutions available on the market seemed to fit my needs. 

The "Documentation" file incldues the final deliverable, an extensive software development plan including business case and risks, user stories, use cases, sequence and class diagrams, and a test plan.

The "User Interface Example" is a powerpoint version of a very rough example of the desired database interface. It can be viewed by downloading the file, then watching in presentation mode in Microsfot PowerPoint.
