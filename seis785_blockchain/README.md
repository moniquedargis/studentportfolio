Here you'll find the materials for my final project for the course SEIS 785 - Blockchain, taken in Fall 2019 as an elective in the MS in Data Science curriculum at the University of St. Thomas.

Though this was not a required course, I was eager to learn more about what was, to me, the mysterious world of blockchain. This solo project was completed under the supervision of instructor David Duccini and proposes a blockchain solution to the problem of tutoring logs in the standardized test preparation industry. Included are the final paper proposal and an accompanying presentation slide deck.
