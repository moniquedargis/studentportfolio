Here youâ€™ll find the materials for my final project for the course SEIS 736 - Big Data Architecture, taken in Spring 2019 as part of the MS in Data Science curriculum at the University of St. Thomas.

This was a solo project, completed under the supervision of Dr. Brad Rubin, that explored a dataset of donations made via DonorsChoose.org, a website that facilitates crowdsourced funding of K-12 classroom projects.  Analysis was completed on a Hadoop cluster using spark-shell with Spark version 1.6. Included are the final paper, spark-shell code, and spark-shell output.
