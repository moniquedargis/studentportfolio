Here youâ€™ll find the materials for my final project for the course SEIS 763 - Machine Learning, taken in Spring 2019 as part of the MS in Data Science curriculum at the University of St. Thomas.

This project was completed as a group with Erik Hutchinson, Connor Mills, and Derek Synan under the tutelage of Dr. Manjeet Rege. The ultimate goal of this project was to explore multiple models that could predict whether a tool would accurately detect thermal asperities in a hard drive. 

My role in this project was primarily to train logistic and linear regression models, which you'll find in this folder. This work was completed in Jupyter notebooks using python 3. I utilized both Principal Component Analysis and Stepwise Selection to reduce the number of features in the dataset. Additionall,y I was primarily responsible for editing our final paper for clarity, grammar, and correct formatting.
