The Gender Guesser for python was designed in PyCharm. All files in this folder should be opened within a PyCharm project.

To begin the program, run "GenderGuesser.py." You'll be given detailed instructions within the program on how to proceed.

When the time comes to input a text file, please choose from one of the files provided:

alice.txt - copy of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll (M), that was provided in class

awakening.txt - copy of The Awakening, by Kate Chopin (F)

heroisms.txt - copy of the first chapter of The Lost World, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (M)

playingpilgrims.txt - copy of the first chapter of Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott (F)

If you would like to try the gender guesser with a different type of writing, please copy and paste the text in to a new .txt file and save it in the same folder as GenderGuesser.py. Please note that you may run into issues with the file encoding if you copy and paste something from a highly stylized website; however, writings from Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.org) seem to work well.

The gender guesser will exit automatically after analyzing the text. If you would like to try again, or analyze a new text, simply restart the program.
