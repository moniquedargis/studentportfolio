In this folder, youâ€™ll find the components of my final project for SEIS 603 - Foundations of Software Development - Python, taken in Spring 2018 as part of the MS in Data Science curriculum at the University of St. Thomas.

This was a solo project in which students were asked to pick a project to implement in python. I chose to replicate the Gender Guesser, a javascript program that guesses the gender of an author based on a selection of their writing. The original Gender Guesser can be found at http://www.hackerfactor.com/GenderGuesser.php.

The "python_code" folder contains the files necessary to run the python implementation of the Gender Guesser. The Gender Guesser was designed in PyCharm and should be run through this IDE when possible.

I have also included two scientific papers that provided the basis for the original Gender Guesser, labeled "Background"

The final requirement of this project involved a screencapture video with narration. You can find my video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMDLZj8nAag
