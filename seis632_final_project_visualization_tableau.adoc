Here you'll find a link to the final visualization project for the course SEIS 632, taken in Fall 2017. 

This visualization was created by a three-person team. My role on this team consisted of being the driving force behind the final story as presented and editing visualizations for detail and consistency. Although the overall story and visualizations are the ones we presented in class, I have edited the story for clarity.
